Program Code
------------

* The MyPaint application and any part of MyPaint not explicitly licensed
  otherwise, is licensed under the GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE version 2
  or later -- see the 'COPYING' file in this directory for details.

* The MyPaint brush library can be found in the brushlib directory,
  and is licensed under the ISC license. Read 'brushlib/COPYING' for
  details. The MyPaint brush collection is not part of that library.


Non-themeable program artwork and icons
---------------------------------------

These images are required for MyPaint to operate correctly, and are not easily
replaceable at runtime. They should be considered "linked" in the GPL sense.

* The icons eye_*.png and lock_*.png in the pixmaps directory are licensed
  under the GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE VERSION 2, and were extracted from
  tango_icons.svg in the Inkscape distribution. They are created by and 
  copyright 2009 the Inkscape Developers, with contributions by "jEsuSdA 8)
  www.jesusda.com" -- see the 'COPYING' file in this directory for details.

* The pixel-only icons in glade/icons/ have been adapted from those in the
  Glade distribution itself. They are licensed under the "GNU General Public
  License as published by the Free Software Foundation; version 2 dated June,
  1991".

* Cursor images are taken from the DMZ Cursors 0.2 distribution.
  These are Copyright (c) 2006 Jakub Steiner <jimmac@novell.com> and
  Copyright (c) 2006 Novell, Inc. They are distributed under the terms of
  the Expat License (described as the "MIT License") -- see the file
  'COPYING.cursors' in this directory for details.

Other icons in the pixmaps/ directory are distributed under the same terms as
MyPaint itself.


Themeable icons
---------------

Images of these sizes and names are required for MyPaint to operate correctly,
but are easily replaceable by the user at runtime. They are installed under the
default "hicolor" Freedesktop.org icon theme, but may be replaced by icons from
any user theme. They should thus not be considered "linked" in the GPL sense.

* Original themeable icons whose sources are in svg/ have been released into
  the public domain. We use the public domain Tango palette.

* Some PNG-only icons found under desktop/ are taken from the Tango
  Desktop Project (http://tango.freedesktop.org/), and are Public Domain.

* Some of the themeable icons in svg/ are derived from Fatcow Hosting's "3000"
  set through tracing and redrawing into SVG. These derivative works are 
  licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 (US) License,
  http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/us/ . When attributing, please
  link to this page on fatcow.com: http://www.fatcow.com/free-icons

SVG sources embed license information on a per-icon basis as Dublin Core
metadata. Themeable icons with licenses which would be incompatible with the
GNU Public License under closer linking, such as CC-By 3.0, should eventually
be replaced with ones which are.


Artists' Resources
------------------

* The brushes and their icons from Set #2 are by David Revoy, and are released
  as cc0/public domain: https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/

* The default palette is by David Revoy, and is released as cc0/public domain:
  https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/

* Some palettes are taken from the GIMP distribution.
  These palettes are Copyright (C) 1995 Spencer Kimball and Peter Mattis, and
  are distributed under the terms of the GNU GPL, Version 2 or later -- see
  the 'COPYING' file in this directory for details.

* Some palettes are taken from the Inkscape distribution.
  These palettes are copyright 2009 the Inkscape Developers, and are
  distributed under the terms of the GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE Version 2 --
  see the 'COPYING' file in this directory for details.

* The "Watercolor" palette is by Tuomas Kuosmanen (@tigert), and is released
  into the Public Domain: https://twitter.com/tigert/status/268938113575960576

For resources, licenses which would restrict artists choice over licensing of
their own work were a palette, background image, or brush to be embedded
automatically into a file created with MyPaint MUST be avoided if any
possibility of such automatic embedding exists with current MyPaint code.

No facility exists at present for embedding palettes, but brush program code
currently does embed. We currently require Public Domain licensing, or CC0, for
brushes and background images as a consequence. Should MyPaint add a facility
for embedding palette data automatically into artwork, those palettes licensed
under the GPL shall be dropped from the distribution.
