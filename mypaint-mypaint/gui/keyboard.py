    This class represents all keyboard shortcuts (similar to
    gtk.AccelGroup). It connects to keyboard events of various
    gtk.Window instances to handle hotkeys. It synchronizes with the
    global gtk accelmap to figure out what keyboard shortcuts the user
    has assigned through the menu.

    The point of the whole exercise (instead of just using gtk
    standard tools) is to allow the action handlers to wait for the
    corresponding key release event.

    This class adds extra state attributes to every gtk.Action.
